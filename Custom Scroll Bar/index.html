          The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
          below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de
          Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
          exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
          translation by H. Rackham.

          There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but
          the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
          humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
          If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure
          there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text

          Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
          Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
          from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
          classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
          comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
          Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
          This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
          the Renaissance.

        <p>
          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
          industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
          since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
          five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged.

          It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
          containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
          publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
          Ipsum.

          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
          has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
          it over 2000 years old

          All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
          predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator
          on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,
          combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate
          Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
