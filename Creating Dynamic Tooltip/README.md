# Dynamic Tooltip

This project creates a simple and stylish tooltip using HTML and CSS. The tooltip appears when you hover over the "Hover Me" text, revealing a distinctive design with a black background and white text. The tooltip is positioned above the text, and its appearance is enhanced by a smooth transition effect. The project is centered on the page, featuring a gradient background and a cursor that changes upon hovering. 

Overall, it's a clean and visually appealing implementation of a dynamic tooltip.
